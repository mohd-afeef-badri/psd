# The first test

To showcase the usage of linear elasticity, we shall discuss here an example of a 2D bar which bends under its own load (body weight). The bar $5$ m in length and $1$ m in width, and is supposed to be made up of a material with density $\rho=8\times 10^3$, Youngs modulus $E=200\times 10^9$, and Poissons ratio $\nu=0.3$. Figure below shows this bar considered in this tutorial.
