* Comment: The intended geometry is a quater of a cylinder in 2D it reduces tp quater *
*          of a circular shell. The internal and external radius of the shell is  Ri  *
*          and Re. We use `-format msh2` as a Gmsh argument to output .msh file   in  *
*          in version 2 format.                                                       *
